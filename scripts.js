//javascript statement (it always end with semicolons)
// function alert to pass string "hello"

var message = "first branch"

//variables

//create a variable and name it
var box;

//assigning a value to a variable
var boxes = 0;
boxes = 1;
//no need to write the word var again to assign a new value.
//concept here is that you create the variable only once, and then assign the value necessarily.
